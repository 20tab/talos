# Warning: Please do not modify the following settings under any circumstances,
# as doing so will completely disrupt the functioning of Talos.

# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data, such as
# password, private keys, and other secrets. These should not be part of version
# control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject
# to change depending on the environment.
# *.tfvars
# *.tfvars.json

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
override.tf

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
# !example_override.tf

# Include tfplan files to ignore the plan output of command: terraform plan -out=tfplan
# example: *tfplan*

# Ignore CLI configuration files
